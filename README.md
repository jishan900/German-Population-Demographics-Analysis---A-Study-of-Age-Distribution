
# German Population Demographics Analysis - A Study of Age Distribution

### Project Overview

This project to explore and understand the shifting demographic patterns in Germany, a topic of significant relevance in current socio-economic discussions. Studying these trends provides insights into changes in population structure, such as aging populations or fluctuations in birth rates, which are crucial for policy making and economic forecasting. The availability of a well-organized dataset from a reliable source like the German government's statistical service (Genesis) likely influenced your decision. This project provides an opportunity to work with real-world data that is both comprehensive and of high quality, which is essential for conducting meaningful exploratory data analysis (EDA). Working on this project allows to develop and refine my analytical skills, particularly in data cleaning, data manipulation, how to understand data, and statistical analysis and serves as a practical application of theoretical knowledge gained in statistics, demography, or data science courses. It enables to apply concepts such as trend analysis, population studies, and data visualization to a real-world dataset, bridging the gap between academic studies and practical implementation.

### The research question of the project
- RQ 1: How have population demographics by age group changed over the years in the dataset?
- RQ 2: In which years was there a significant change in the age distribution? 
- RQ 3: How has the number under 1 year population changed (Increased/Decreased) from 1970 to 2022 in Germany?
- RQ 4: In which year the minimum population has been found under any age group from 1970 to 2022 in Germany?
- RQ 5: What is the increase/decrease rate 18 years age group population from 1970 to 2022 in Germany?


### Requirements
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9.13
- **Computing platform:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Library:** Numpy, Pandas, OS, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Git Bash

### Dataset 
The dataset used in this project is collected from the Statistisches Bundesamt and is based on information about the German population. 
The dataset has a sample size of 53 observations and 22 variables. The variables of the dataset are 'Year', 'under 1 year', '1 year', 
'2 years', '3 years', '4 years', '5 years', '6 years', '7 years', '8 years', '9 years', '10 years', '11 years', '12 years', '13 years', 
'14 years', '15 years', '16 years', '17 years', '18 years', '19 years', 'Total'.  

After collecting the data, it was discovered that there were a few problems in the dataset. For example, additional information is 
added to the CSV dataset, which is unnecessary for the EDA analysis. Moreover, the format of the data was not correct. So, it was fixed 
manually in Excel and saved as a new CSV file. After that, it was discovered that the dataset was well organized and that there were no 
missing values in the entire dataset. Overall, the data quality is considered to be good.
