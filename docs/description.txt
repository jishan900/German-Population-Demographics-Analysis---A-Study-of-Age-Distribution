About the Dataset: 

The dataset used in this project is collected from the Statistisches Bundesamt and is based on information about the German population. 
The dataset has a sample size of 53 observations and 22 variables. The variables of the dataset are 'Year', 'under 1 year', '1 year', 
'2 years', '3 years', '4 years', '5 years', '6 years', '7 years', '8 years', '9 years', '10 years', '11 years', '12 years', '13 years', 
'14 years', '15 years', '16 years', '17 years', '18 years', '19 years', 'Total'. 


After collecting the data, it was discovered that there were a few problems in the dataset. For example, additional information is 
added to the CSV dataset, which is unnecessary for the EDA analysis. Moreover, the format of the data was not correct. So, it was fixed 
manually in Excel and saved as a new CSV file. After that, it was discovered that the dataset was well organized and that there were no 
missing values in the entire dataset. Overall, the data quality is considered to be good. 


The datasets originate from the German government's statistical data service, [Genesis, ]{https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online}.

Research Question:

RQ 1: How have population demographics by age group changed over the years in the dataset? 

RQ 2: In which years was there a significant change in the age distribution? 

RQ 3: How has the number under 1 year population changed (Increased/Decreased) from 1970 to 2022 in Germany?

RQ 4: In which year the minimum population has been found under any age group from 1970 to 2022 in Germany?

RQ 5: What is the increase/decrease rate 18 years age group population from 1970 to 2022 in Germany?
